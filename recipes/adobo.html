    <h3>Short description</h3>
    <p>Philippine adobo (from Spanish: adobar: "marinade", "sauce" or "seasoning" <br>
       English: /əˈdoʊboʊ/ Tagalog pronunciation: [ɐdobo]) is a popular Filipino dish and cooking process in Philippine cuisine. <br>
       In its base form, meat, seafood, or vegetables are first browned in oil, and then marinated and simmered in vinegar, salt and/or soy sauce, and garlic. <br>
       It is often considered the unofficial national dish in the Philippines.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken (cut into serving pieces)</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Garlic (minced or crushed)</li>
        <li>Bay leaves</li>
        <li>Black peppercorns</li>
        <li>Onion (optional, sliced)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, combine the chicken pieces, soy sauce, garlic, onion, peppercorns, and bay leaves. <br>
            Massage the marinade into the chicken and let it sit for at least 30 minutes, or overnight for more flavor.</li> <br>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pan over medium heat. <br>
            Remove the chicken from the marinade (but save the marinade!) <br>
            and brown the pieces in the hot oil, about 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden.</li> <br>
        <li>Once the chicken is browned, pour in the vinegar and let it simmer for about 2-3 minutes (don’t stir immediately to preserve the vinegar’s tangy flavor). <br>
            Then, add the reserved marinade back into the pan, along with the bay leaves.  </li><br>
        <li>Add 1/2 cup of water (optional, for a more sauce-heavy adobo). Let the mixture come to a boil, <br>
            then lower the heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes until the chicken is tender and the sauce has reduced and thickened. Stir occasionally.</li><br>
        <li>Taste the sauce and add salt and pepper to your preference. Serve the chicken adobo with steamed rice. Enjoy the rich, tangy flavor!</li>
